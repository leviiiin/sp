          <p class="about-hero__description">
            Sticky Password was founded in 2001 by Alex (bottom row, left), shown with the sales and marketing team in our home city of Brno, Czech Republic. As a programmer struggling to manage his growing list of passwords, Alex built a tool for himself—one that quickly became essential for his friends and family, too. What began as a imple Windows solution in a local town has since grown into a <b>global password manager</b> supporting Windows, Android, iOS, and Mac, used by customers in almost every country around the world.
