    "question": "Why do I need a password manager?",
    "answer": "<p>The problem with passwords is that we have too many of them, so we take shortcuts. We use easy passwords that make the 'Worst Password Lists' every year (like <i>qwerty123, password1, Ihatepasswords...</i>), and we reuse passwords for multiple accounts, and that's what hackers take advantage of.</p><strong>A password manager is the best way to create and manage all your long, strong and unique passwords.</strong><p>Sticky Password helps defend you against hackers by securely storing, managing, and generating strong passwords for your various online accounts. It acts as a digital vault where your logins and passwords are saved in encrypted format. With a password manager, you only need to remember one master password to access them.</p>"

    "question": "Is there a difference between using Sticky Password and using the password saving feature in browsers?",
    "answer": "<p>In a word, the difference is security. Letting the browser focus on browsing, and the password manager focus on creating, filling in, and securely storing passwords leads to better security.</p><p>Browsers, much like internet routers or firewalls, serve as a primary interface for connecting with the external digital world. This 'frontline' position makes them particularly vulnerable to a variety of threats. An external password manager, especially a native platform application like Sticky Password, can be thought of as working behind the lines; as such we can look at the interaction with the browser as limited and controlled by actions of the user. This detachment between the browser and the password manager benefits from additional layers of protection that include an encrypted database, secure backup storage, and second-factor authentication. These features collectively reduce the risk of your passwords being compromised by malicious websites or injected scripts.</p><p>Unlike using the password saving capabilities of browsers - which ties you to a single browser - Sticky Password gives you the freedom to access your passwords across all major browsers - whether you're using Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, Brave, Opera, or others. No matter where you create your accounts, Sticky Password ensures your passwords are always at your fingertips, no matter how you choose to surf the web.</p><p>And, of course, with Sticky Passwords local and cloud sync options, you can access your passwords anywhere and anytime - on all your devices.</p>"

For example 'surf dent' could become fruS10*tned.</li></ul><p><strong>Here's what you should avoid when creating your Master Password:</strong></p><ul style=\"color: red\"><li>Using your StickyID in any form (reversed, capitalized, and certainly not as-is).</li><li>Using your first, middle, or last name, or your pet's, parent's, sweetheart's, or child's name.</li><li>Using a common dictionary word.</li></ul>"
